        year: "December 2023"
        desc: "We constructed a super-pangenome to represent and analyze North American wild species of the Vitis genus. The assembly of phased diploid genomes for the nine selected species was a fundamental starting point to ensure an accurate representation of genetic variations that occur within and between genomes. We were able to navigate through different layers of information integrated within the pangenome graph from large structural variations to single-nucleotide polymorphisms.

        year: "November 2023"
        desc: "We sequenced fifty isolates from viticulture regions worldwide and built nucleotide-level, reference-free pangenomes for each species. Through examining genomic diversity and pangenome structure, we analyzed intraspecific conservation and variability of putative virulence factors, focusing on functions under positive selection, and recent gene-family dynamics of contraction and expansion.
